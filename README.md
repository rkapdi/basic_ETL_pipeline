# Rick and Morty ETL Project

This project is a simple Flask application that demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using the Rick and Morty API. The application is hosted on Heroku and allows users to interact with the API through a responsive interface.

## Live Demo

The application can be accessed live at: [https://rick-morty-etl.herokuapp.com/](https://rick-morty-etl.herokuapp.com/)

## Features

* **Extract**: The application extracts data from the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).
* **Transform**: Users can perform simple transformations on the data.
* **Load**: The transformed data is then presented in a responsive table format.

## How to Use

Simply enter the parameters you want to search by in the text fields and hit 'submit'. The application will handle the extraction, transformation, and loading of the data, presenting it back to you in a user-friendly format.

## Tech Stack

* Flask (Python)
* HTML/CSS
* Heroku for deployment

## Future Enhancements

This project is still in development. Future enhancements may include more complex transformations and a broader variety of API endpoints to interact with.
